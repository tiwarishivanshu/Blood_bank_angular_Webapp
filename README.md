once done with installing angular you can add materials and angular via:
      materials: ng add @angular/material [Matrials is a great framework for building UI's and easy to implement so i have used materials for the                                               project].
      Bootstrap: npm install --save bootstrap [Bootstrap is a great framework for building responsive apps using the bootstrap grid system, and I                                                     have used Bootstrap fro the same]
